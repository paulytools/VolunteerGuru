# Volunteer Guru

Welcome to our program, the Volunteer Guru.</br>
This system is designed to match Charity Organizations with volunteers that have pre-determined interests and location based on the user profile created.</br>
Organizations can create events for their charity and invite users to participate in the events. These users will be searched based on their interests and geographical location.</br>
Volunteers also have the power to use the search function to find an organization or event based on their interests or location. Volunteers can join events and follow organizations for notice on future events for the organization.</br>
We hope to bring users a simplified and organized system to find the Organization/Volunteers that best match their criteria.</br></br>
