# Volunteer Guru #


Welcome to our program, the Volunteer Guru!

This system is designed to match Charity Organizations with volunteers that have pre-determined interests and location based on the user profile created.


- Organizations: 
	Search for volunteers based on their interests and geographical location.
	Can create events for their charity.
	Invite users to participate in the events. 
	
- Volunteers:
	Search to find an organization or event based on their interests or location. 
	Join events 
	Follow organizations for notice on future events.


We hope to bring users a simplified and organized system to find the Organization/Volunteers that best match their criteria.
