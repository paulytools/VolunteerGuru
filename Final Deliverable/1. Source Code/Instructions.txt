Source Code (.java files) with README ("how to install and run" instructions)
* A zip file containing source code files and a text file README/how to install instructions
* Goal: anyone to be able to download and run your application per your instructions
* Having example data (e.g. a few example records to start with) would be helpful as long as it is obvious how to use it/apply to the code.
* Please make sure your java project can be installed and run by anyone with minimal effort. 
Too many times there are complex dependencies, database issues, or similar. 
An easy check is to install and run in a class computer. 
Even better, using the cmd line.
